libsongprint 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New in this release:

* Added another install target: libsongprintfile.  This library
exports the function sp_identify_file(), aimed at application
developers who just want to ID mp3, vorbis, and wav files without the
hassle of writing codec support functions.  libsongprint is still
there for applications that supply a decoder.  The example program now
uses libsongprintfile.
 
* libsongprint now returns the eTantrum media ID and moreinfo URLs in
the sp_id structure.
