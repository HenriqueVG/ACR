WHAT'S HERE:

This is an abridged version of the Vorbis library, pared down to
only include enough to compile the required libraries used in 
decoding a Vorbis file.  For the full Vorbis library, go to
http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/

This package was prepared by Jon Shiring (jshiring@etantrum.com).

WHAT IS VORBIS:

Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the
month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
All the technical details are published and documented, and any
software entity may make full use of the format without royalty or
patent concerns.

CONTACT:

The OggSquish homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/ogg/'.
Vorbis's homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/'.
Up to date technical documents, contact information, source code and
pre-built utilities may be found there.

BUILD:

A standard build should consist of nothing more than:

./configure
make 

and as root if desired :

make install

This will install the ogg vorbis commandline encoder/player ('ogg')
into /usr/local/bin, the ogg player and libvorbis manpages into
/usr/local/man/ and libvorbis.a into /usr/local/lib.
