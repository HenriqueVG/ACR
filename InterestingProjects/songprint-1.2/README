Introduction
============

This is version 1.0 of the songprint library, a library for acoustic
fingerprinting of music and queries using eTantrum's song identification 
service. 

We encourage your participation!  If you'd like to help out with
development, visit http://freetantrum.org, or join our mailing list at
http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/freetantrum-devel.

Requirements
============

The songprint library requires the following additional libraries:

  - FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/)  
  - glib (http://www.gtk.org/) 

Installation
============

Configure and make should be sufficient for compiling songprint on
your platform.  Check the INSTALL file for more details.  

Codecs for the reference implementation can be disabled at configure
time.  Run configure with --help for information on these options.

Note on fftw: make sure you compile fftw with the shared object flag

Win32 Build Specific Settings
=============================

You must modify the Project Settings for the sp_sdk_lib and sp_sdk_dll
projects so that it can find the above required libraries and include
files.  To do this, enter project settings, select the C/C++ tab, 
select the Preprocessor Category, and enter the correct path to the
glib and fftw header files in the "Additional include directories"
edit box.  When trying to build the sp_sdk_dll library, you will need
to also go to the Link tab, select the Input Category, and enter the
correct path to the glib and fftw library files in the "Additional
library path" edit box.  The same changes must be made to the Win32 GUI
example program in order to get it to build properly.
